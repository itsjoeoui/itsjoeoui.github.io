## TreeHugger - A Social App for Reconnecting With Nature (Prototype)

**GITHUB**: https://github.com/space-treehugger

**ARTICLE**: https://space.dawsoncollege.qc.ca/explorations/article/treehugger

The app would allow users to leave virtual messages on specific locations of trees. These messages would be public, meaning that any other user nearby could view the message and reply. Each tree would essentially act as its own discussion board. This app is built with React Native, and the backend is hosted on Firebase.

The TreeHugger Team - Joey Yu, Hristo Sandev and Shawn Maor.

## Heat Mapping and Dynamic Heat Distribution

**GITHUB**: https://github.com/itsjoeoui/mcgill-phys-hack-2020

**YOUTUBE**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok2_Vdl1S_I

Project for the McGill Physics Hackathon 2020.

Winner of the P4 Momentum Labs coding challenge.

The Heat Rover challenge:

1. A warm up problem!
   The robotics environment represents a uniform, square 2D plate of unknown dimensions at a fixed time. A heat source was located at the centre of the plate. Hackers were asked to use the ultrasonic sensor to measure distances and the temperature sensor to make a heat map of the plate using the robot as a rover. There are more efficient ways to do this in the real world of course, but they are not as fun!

2. Now for some #physicsâ€‹!
   Using the heat map made from the rover data as initial conditions for the 2D plate, and assuming the plate is isolated with the source removed, hackers were asked to simulate the heat transfer in the plate.

## COVID-19 Data Visualization

**GITHUB**: https://github.com/itsjoeoui/corona-map

A simple COVID-19 data visualization tool built with Dash.

Archived, and it may break any time in the future as it depends on the owid's covid-19-data API.

Preview: https://corona.itsjoeoui.com (Open on desktop browsers)

Note: This is a Heroku app, and it usually takes up to a minute to load up.
