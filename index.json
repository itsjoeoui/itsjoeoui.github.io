These messages would be public, meaning that any other user nearby could view the message and reply. Each tree would essentially act as its own discussion board. This app is built with React Native, and the backend is hosted on Firebase.\nThe TreeHugger Team - Joey Yu, Hristo Sandev and Shawn Maor.\n Discord Bot GITHUB: https://github.com/itsjoeoui/pydiscord\nFeature list:\n Admin - Simple group management actions such as kick/ban/unban. Game - Nothing fancy yet, just rolling dice. Math - Wait it\u0026rsquo;s all Wolfram|Alpha? Always has been. Music - The usual stuff, needs some improvements tho. Stats - Currently supports chess.com and weather stats Others - Where the fun begins!  It also allows people to chat anonymously on Discord channels!\n Heat Mapping and Dynamic Heat Distribution GITHUB: https://github.com/itsjoeoui/mcgill-phys-hack-2020\nYOUTUBE: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok2_Vdl1S_I\nProject for the McGill Physics Hackathon 2020.\nWinner of the P4 Momentum Labs coding challenge.\nThe Heat Rover challenge:\n  A warm up problem! The robotics environment represents a uniform, square 2D plate of unknown dimensions at a fixed time. A heat source was located at the centre of the plate. Hackers were asked to use the ultrasonic sensor to measure distances and the temperature sensor to make a heat map of the plate using the robot as a rover. There are more efficient ways to do this in the real world of course, but they are not as fun!\n  Now for some #physicsâ€‹! Using the heat map made from the rover data as initial conditions for the 2D plate, and assuming the plate is isolated with the source removed, hackers were asked to simulate the heat transfer in the plate.\n   COVID-19 Data Visualization GITHUB: https://github.com/itsjoeoui/corona-map\nA simple COVID-19 data visualization tool built with Dash.\nArchived, and it may break any time in the future as it depends on the owid\u0026rsquo;s covid-19-data API.\nPreview: https://corona.itsjoeoui.com (Open on desktop browsers)\nNote: This is a Heroku app, and it usually takes up to a minute to load up.\n PixelExperience for OnePlus 5/5T GITHUB: https://github.com/PixelExperience\nWEBSITE: https://download.pixelexperience.org/\nPixelExperience is an AOSP based ROM, with Google apps included and all Pixel goodies (launcher, wallpapers, icons, fonts, bootanimation).\nContributions:\n  Maintainer for the OnePlus 5/5T (Snapdragon 835 Mobile Platform).\n  Merging upstream changes from LineageOS and Linux Kernel Stable v.4.4.x tag.\n    #NeverStopLearning\n ","permalink":"https://itsjoeoui.com/projects/","summary":"Astro: Star Formation McGill Physics Hackathon 2021 Project - Winner of the Astro Challenge.\nGITHUB: https://github.com/itsjoeoui/mcgill-phys-hack-2021\nYOUTUBE: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JG4PJDeQ5Hw\nDEVPOST: https://devpost.com/software/star-formation\nIt simulates the formation of stars using Newton\u0026rsquo;s second law of motion, and the simulation is built using Pygame with a custom-built Particle class in Python.\n TreeHugger - A Social App for Reconnecting With Nature (Prototype) GITHUB: https://github.com/space-treehugger\nARTICLE: https://space.dawsoncollege.qc.ca/explorations/article/treehugger\nThe app would allow users to leave virtual messages on specific locations of trees.","title":"My Projects"},{"content":" I\u0026rsquo;m currently seeking for software development summer 2022 internship :))\n Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ This is Joey, and I\u0026rsquo;m known around the internet as itsjoeoui.\nI\u0026rsquo;m a 2nd-year student at Dawson College, studying Pure and Applied Science.\nI used to work on Open-Source Projects.
