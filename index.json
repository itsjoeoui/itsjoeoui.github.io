Game - Nothing fancy yet, just rolling dice. Math - Wait it\u0026rsquo;s all Wolfram|Alpha? Always has been. Music - The usual stuff, needs some improvements tho. Stats - Currently supports chess.com and weather stats Others - Where the fun begins!

The robotics environment represents a uniform, square 2D plate of unknown dimensions at a fixed time. A heat source was located at the centre of the plate. Hackers were asked to use the ultrasonic sensor to measure distances and the temperature sensor to make a heat map of the plate using the robot as a rover. There are more efficient ways to do this in the real world of course, but they are not as fun!\n  Now for some #physicsâ€‹! Using the heat map made from the rover data as initial conditions for the 2D plate, and assuming the plate is isolated with the source removed, hackers were asked to simulate the heat transfer in the plate.\n   COVID-19 Data Visualization GITHUB: https://github.com/itsjoeoui/corona-map\nA simple COVID-19 data visualization tool built with Dash.\nArchived, and it may break any time in the future as it depends on the owid\u0026rsquo;s covid-19-data API.\nPreview: https://corona.itsjoeoui.com (Open on desktop browsers)\nNote: This is a Heroku app, and it usually takes up to a minute to load up.\n PixelExperience for OnePlus 5/5T and OnePlus 7 Pro GITHUB: https://github.com/PixelExperience\nWEBSITE: https://download.pixelexperience.org/\nPixelExperience is an AOSP based ROM, with Google apps included and all Pixel goodies (launcher, wallpapers, icons, fonts, bootanimation).\nOur mission is to offer the maximum possible stability and security, along with essential and useful features for the proper functioning of the device.\n  Thanks to everyone who followed me on GitHub :) #NeverStopLearning\n ","permalink":"https://itsjoeoui.com/projects/","summary":"TreeHugger - A Social App for Reconnecting With Nature (WIP) GITHUB: https://github.com/space-treehugger\nARTICLE: https://space.dawsoncollege.qc.ca/explorations/article/treehugger\nThe app would allow users to leave virtual messages on specific locations of trees.
